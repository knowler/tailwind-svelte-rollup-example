# Tailwind + Svelte + Rollup

This is a demo using:

* Tailwind CSS
* Svelte
* Rollup
* Purgecss

HTML + CSS + JS assets weigh about 11kB (not gzipped). Of course
a larger site/app would have much more to it, but this is a
pretty good starting point given that a site using React is a
minimum of around 120kB and many drop-in CSS frameworks can be
100-200kB. Starting small and with what you actually need is
good.
